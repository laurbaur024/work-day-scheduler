# Work Day Schedule

## Activity

- This is a work day scheduler for people to use to help plan and manage their daily work load. 
- Information that you type can be saved locally and it is color coded so users can easily see what time of the day it is.

## User Instructions

- Type in your work for any given hour block.
- Hit the blue save button. This will save your information locally.

- The hour blocks will update their color based on the current time.
